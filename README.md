At the beginning of the week, I started to really develop and design our translation apps user interface. I continued to work on it until midway through the week. Than I started to find how to connect the the api. In the research, I discovered that the api was not going to work and found googles. And I am currently working on how to connect.

I started development of the quiz application. I designed the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the quiz. At the end of the first week I had the HTML and some CSS set up, but nothing in script.js. This week I started developement on the functionality portion of the quiz and the rest of the CSS. Today we added the home button, added questions to my array, and connected it to the main page.

Tried to get a background image for the whole website but it didn't work even though I looked through W3 schools and stack overflow.

I tried to help with the API but got told the API was not able to be salvaged before the presentation

Did quality assurance test for the quiz portion for any issues and found none.Created the Presentation slides for our presentation on thursday the 7th of December.

11/25/23 - 12/6/23
During this period of time, we continued to try to connect the api to our project. However, we ran out of time and were not able to connect it. Afterwards, I help team members wrap up final touches and tested the application.
