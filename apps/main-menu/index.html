        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome! To begin, I would like to mention that I hope
          you enjoy our application. However, before you go any further, you
          should know a little more about us and what our application does.
          <br />
          <br />

          &nbsp; &nbsp; In this application you will see many things that could
          be useful on a daily basis. When the user first loads into this
          application, they will see our home page. This home page contains our
          navigation bar that allows the user to navigate between the different
          pages of our application. You will also see a brief description of us
          and what our application does. At this current point in time, this is
          a work in progress so all the pages in the navigation bar might not be
          created yet.
          <br />
          <br />

          &nbsp; &nbsp; This application is also a showcase of many different
          things. Firstly, it shows what the creators Nathan, Logan, and Jared
          learned throughout the semester so far. Secondly, it allows us to
          learn Git and how to work together to manage and effectively manage a
          GitHub repository. Lastly, it allows us to build our skills in
          communication and teamwork.
          <br />
          <br />

          &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope you found that this application can be useful. If
          there are any comments, or anything you would like us to add, please
          feel free to let us know and it could be added.
